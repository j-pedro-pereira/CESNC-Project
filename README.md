# CESNC-Project

Within the scope of CESNC curriculum this project involves a creation of a Python-made tool known as Crawler/Scraper to withdraw important information such as passwords, addresses and other relevant information from GitHub repositories. Possibly if the group ends the main objectives, it can be feasible to setup the Crawler/Scraper to refresh every x minutes and other optional functionalities to enhance said tool.


## Objectives:
(1) be familiar with the Python programming language; 

(2) create a Crawler that will search GitHub for projects containing sensitive data (Hosts, IP, addresses and passwords; 

(3) create a Scraper that extracts information from said source (GitHub); 

(4) creation of database for indexing and storing the retrieved information.

## Tools to be used:

For the creation of the Python tool, it will be needed an IDE (integrated development environment) that supports Python. Thus it will be used VS Code for this project as it is extremely powerful and supports other languages, in case of need. For example, it can be used to create a “dummy” webpage to test if the scraper is indeed working properly. Also, the “Inspect Element” embedded in Chromium Browsers will be heavily relied to extract HTML tags, elements and content.

It will be used an file hosting service, in order to store and safeguard (backup) all Files and Documents that will be used or created during the enrollment of this project. For such the group will use the Windows Office Suite (that includes the OneDrive) that grants IPVC students to have full access to these tools because of the Microsoft Partnership.
